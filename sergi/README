The data that needs to be analyzed for the paper are the ones in the different subdirectories present in `toys`, namely

NN_linear_deg10
NN_linear_deg5
PO_sp500_part2_ra10_mult4
PO_sp500_part3_ra10_mult2
PO_sp500_part3_ra10_mult4
PO_sp500_part3_ra20_mult4
SPP_p15
SPP_p25


I fixed the numebr of samples to 1000 in the code, but you can change it if you want to debug something. To do so, just change the variable `n_samples` in the last lines of code in `codes/run_database.py`.

As for the other settings to change, that's pretty easy, you just need to change the **name of the database** to be run and correspondingly the final file with analyzed data to be saved, for example, to analyze and save the computation done for the database SSP_15 just set:

- test_set = "../toys/SPP_15" 
at line 172 of `codes/run_database.py`
- file = open("../data/SPP_15.txt", "wb")
at line 178 of `codes/run_database.py`

Finally, the last thing to be changed is the **number of binary variables** to test for. This is not uniform for all databases, so at line 169 of the code just set:

- bvars = np.arange(6, 25, 3)
for all PO databases with partition number 3, namely
PO_sp500_part3_ra10_mult2
PO_sp500_part3_ra10_mult4
PO_sp500_part3_ra20_mult4

- bvars = np.arange(6, 25, 2)
for PO_sp500_part2_ra10_mult4

- bvars = np.arange(6, 26)
for all SPP databases, namely
SPP_p15
SPP_p25

- bvars = np.arange(4, 26)
for all NN databases, namely
NN_linear_deg10
NN_linear_deg5


And that's it! Thank you :)
